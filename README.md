Simulation Workflow
1. Initialization:
  -	Prepare the initial structure (3i40.pdb) and generate the corresponding PSF file (init_3i40.psf).
	-	Run the initialization script (init_3i40.inp) to set up the system.
2. Energy Minimization:
  -	Use minimize_3i40.inp to perform energy minimization and obtain a stable starting structure.
3. Heating:
  -	Apply the heating protocol with Solvated_insulin_heat.inp to gradually increase the system’s temperature.
4. Production Run:
  -	Conduct the main MD simulation using insulin_dyna_run.inp.
	-	Monitor the simulation through output logs (insulin_dyna_run.out) and trajectory files (insulin_dyna_run.dcd).
5. Analysis:
  -	Evaluate atomic fluctuations using the provided fluctuation output files.
	-	Process energy data with the energy.awk script to assess system stability and behavior.
